# Hamming Distance Calculator
This is a vlsi design of a hamming distance calculator circuit.This repository contains the schematics and layout of a hamming distance calculator circuit done using Pyxis(Mentor Graphics). 
In this circuit, the hamming distance of two 3-bit sequences input serially are computed and the output is given in parallel format in binary form.
  
Main features:
  * Contains schematic and layout of a Serial In-Parallel Out module(3 bits).
  * Contains transmission gate implementation of XOR  logic.
